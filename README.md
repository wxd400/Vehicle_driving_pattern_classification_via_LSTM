# Vehicle_driving_pattern_classification_via_LSTM

This repository illustrate a classification on vehicular driving pattern, using the data of "Vehicle Energy Dataset" from https://github.com/gsoh/VED

The classification is achieved via the deep learning model of LSTM, which classifies the vehicular data into three categories according to their driving profile.
